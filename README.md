# string builder #

It's a simple, dumb, lightweight string builder implementation for those who have to work with C-style strings and won't link fat libraries.

### Versions ###

The main version is a C++ class with a straighforward realisation and quite obvious interface. 
There is also a pure C, procedure-based verision, that is just a rewrite of original C++ class.

### Installation ###

Just drop the files in your project. May be you'll need to do some edits to satisfy your compiler/IDE idiosyncrasies.

### License ###
