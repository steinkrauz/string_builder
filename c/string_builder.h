/**
*
* \brief Trivial StringBuilder implementation
*
* These routines are intended to provide simple, lightweight drop-in
* functionality for building a C string. You may want to fine-tune
* them by changing \c BASE_SIZE and \c ADD_SIZE definitions.
*
* \note The first buffer is size of BASE_SIZE and allocated statically. The resulted string
* returned by \c SB_to_string() function is allocated dynamically and must be freed after use.
