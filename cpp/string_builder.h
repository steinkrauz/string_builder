/**
* \class string_builder
*
* \brief Trivial StringBuilder implementation
*
* This class is intended to provide simple, lightweight drop-in
* functionality for building a C-style string. You may want to fine-tune
* this class by changing \c BASE_SIZE and \c ADD_SIZE definitions.
*
* \note The first buffer is size of BASE_SIZE and allocated statically. The resulted string
* returned by \c to_string() method is allocated dynamically and must be freed after use.
